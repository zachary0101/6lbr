6LBR is a 6LoWPAN Border Router based on The Contiki Operating System.

This repository ports cetic/6lbr onto stm32f103 platform.
The hardware uses stm32f103ret6 as the core control unit.
Ethernet part uses enc28j60, and radio part uses at86rf231.

The modification mainly include three part:

First, cpu/arm/stm32f103/.

This project uses libopencm3 as the firmware library for stm32.
So I modify the cpu related code with libopencm3.
NOTE: libopencm3 has a function called timer_reset(), it conflicts with
 the same name function in contiki sys/timer.c, so I change all of the 
 timer_reset() in contiki into contiki_timer_reset().

Second, platform/stm32-gateway/.
This is the platform code for my gateway hardware. another folder called 
stm32-mote is the leaf node, which is used together with examples/er-rest-example 
to test the function of the gateway. The two hardware is compatible except that 
the gateway has enc28j60 but the mote doesn't.

Third, examples/6lbr-router/.
This is the main code for 6lbr. 6lbr has three modes but I only use the router mode.
You can easily change the code into the other two modes. And examples/er-rest-example
is a CoAP server example, which is used on stm32-mote hardware for a test.

Now it can perform the basic router function.

The code is really rough, hope it has some reference value for you!
